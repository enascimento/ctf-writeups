## Write-up
This challenge was a hit and miss but essentially, was inspired by a [previous CTF challenge](https://github.com/ctfs/write-ups-2016/tree/master/open-ctf-2016/steganography/ultra-encryption-100). After a bit of tweaking, I finally fixed my [script](solve.py) to solve it. I will not go into too much details on how the solution solves the flag, as the link referenced earlier has a much better explanation than I do :).

    $ ./solve.py 
    easyctf{ill_miss_you}

Therefore, the flag is `easyctf{ill_miss_you}`.
