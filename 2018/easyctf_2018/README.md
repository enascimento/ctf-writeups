# EasyCTF 2018 Writeup
I had a blast the last 10 days. This was one of the more enjoyable CTFs I've played and I'm rather happy that I achieved 2nd place out of 1791 teams and out of the **_53_** challenges, I had solved **_52_**. The hardest challenge in my opinion was a tie between AES (which I have not solved) and License Check (which I solved).
