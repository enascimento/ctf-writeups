# EasyCTF_2018: Subset Counting

**Category:** Programming
**Points:** 55
**Description:**

>Given a set of numbers, print out how many non-empty subsets sum to a given integer.

>Input Format
>The first line contains two integers N and S. The second line contains N space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_N.

    1 <= N <= 20
    -100 <= S <= 100
    -1000 <= a_i <= 1000

>Output Format
>A single integer, the number of non-empty subsets which sum to S. Two subsets are different if an element appears in one and does not appear in the other. Note that a_1 is distinct from a_2, even if their values are identical.

>Sample Input

    6 5
    2 4 1 1 1 2

>Sample Ouput

    8

## Write-up
Like the previous challenges, this can be solved with pre-existing Python implementations just [tweaked](solve.py). This is an example of the _given sum problem_.

Therefore, there is no flag.
