# EasyCTF_2018: Taking Input

**Category:** Programming
**Points:** 30
**Description:**

>OK, OK, you got Hello, world down, but can you greet specific people?

You'll be given the input of a certain name. Please greet that person using the same format. For example, if the given input is `Michael`, print `Hello, Michael`!.

For Python, consider the `input()` function.
For Java, consider `System.in`.
For C, consider including `stdio.h` and reading input using `read`.
For C++, consider including `iostream` and reading input using `cin`.

## Write-up
[Dead simple challenge](solve.py),

    print("Hello, " + input() + "!")

Therefore, there is no flag.
