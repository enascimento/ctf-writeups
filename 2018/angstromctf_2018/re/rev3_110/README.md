# AngstromCTF_2018: rev3

**Category:** Reverse
**Points:** 110
**Description:**

>Let's try [Rev 3](rev3_32)! For this executable, you will need to figure out what input makes the program return `"Correct"`. You don't need the shell server for this one, but the binary can be found at `/problems/rev3/` on the shell server.

## Write-up
Just another reversing challenge that I forgot to do a writeup of. Thankfully, I have a [script](solve.py) for everything.

    # ./solve.py 
    actf{reversing_aint_too_bad_eh?}

Therefore, the flag is `actf{reversing_aint_too_bad_eh?}`.
