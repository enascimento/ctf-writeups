>For several challenges, being able to run executables on the shell server will be very important. For this challenge, you will need to connect via ssh to the shell server and navigate to /problems/run_me/. Once there, you will need to run the executable file using the command ./run_me.

## Write-up
Another simple challenge,

    team902619@shell:/problems/run_me$ ./run_me 
    actf{why_did_you_run_me}

Therefore, the flag is `actf{why_did_you_run_me}`
