## Write-up
This time around, we have to crack the password hash of `bdc87b9c894da5168059e00ebffb9077`. Using an online cracking site, we find that the plaintext is `password1234`. Logging in with the password, we get our flag.

    Welcome, admin. Here is your flag: actf{md5_hash_browns_and_pasta_sauce}

Therefore, the flag is `actf{md5_hash_browns_and_pasta_sauce}`.
