# CrossCTF 2017 Writeup
Where to begin? Well, I guess I'll begin right at the start before I even decided to join this competition. 2-3 months back before we even had the qualifiers, I tried to join [CDDC 2017](https://www.dsta.gov.sg/cddc) but was rejected with an excuse of too many participants, so I turned to CrossCTF for my salvation.

Preliminiaries was marginally fun, with challenges from all categories and incorporating various techniques and vulnerabilities that I had not even heard of till this CTF, like SHA-256 collision. I learnt a lot and during those 48 hours, I tried my very best to bring my team up so we would qualify for the finals. As such, we came in 4th place, with the only uncompleted challenge being `LeapFrog`.

Finals was intensely hard and difficult. Two contributing factors to that is the full-binary nature of it, coupled with the 24-hour marathon-style of the competition, so I had to deal with both binary, my weakest CTF category as well as the lack of sleep. Nevertheless, I tried my best and managed to secure the 7th place at 12pm, tieing in place with the 5th and 6th team from Nanyang Polytechnic.

Learnt much, got much to learn.
