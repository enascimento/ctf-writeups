>Keith infiltrated the scary evil organization ZORE, and had to fight a cloned stegosaurus!
After killing the evil beast, he started to dissect the body for potential information. He found a usb containing two similar looking image files: one called [logo.png](logo.png), and one called [changed.png](changed.png).
