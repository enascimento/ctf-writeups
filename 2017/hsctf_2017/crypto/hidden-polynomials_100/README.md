**Category:** Crypto
**Points:** 100
**Description:**

>Alice is sending a top secret polynomial, P(x), to Bob. You want to know the equation of P(x). In your attempts to intercept their message, you discover only two facts about P(x):
It’s coefficients are in the set {0, 1, 2, …, 1000}.
P(2017) = 49189926321482294101673925793095
The flag will be P(1). 

## Write-up
Create a Python to solve it for you

[Solution](solve.py)

Therefore, the flag is `231`.
