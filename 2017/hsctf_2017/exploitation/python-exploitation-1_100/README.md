Note- The flag can be mistaken for an error message. 

## Write-up
This one was meant to be simple, involving the use of Python 2s completely insecure `input()` function which uses an `eval(raw_input())` wrapper. We can easily hijack this by supplementing the input with the password variable like `thisisthepassword` or we can take it a step further.

[For this one though, I'll just be spawning a shell.](solve.py)

Therefore, the flag is `eh nah`.
