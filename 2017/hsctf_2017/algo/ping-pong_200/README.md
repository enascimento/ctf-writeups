# HSCTF_2017: Ping Pong

**Category:** Algo
**Points:** 200
**Description:**

>Keith has encountered a wild Ping Pong interpreter on his hike into the woods. The interpreter will only let him complete his hike if you write a program to find fibonacci numbers! Can you help Keith?
Your program must read a number n from input and then print out the nth Fibonacci number. For the purposes of this problem, the first, second, and third numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are 1, 1, 2. n will be in [1, 46], so that fib(n) will be < 2^31 - 1.
