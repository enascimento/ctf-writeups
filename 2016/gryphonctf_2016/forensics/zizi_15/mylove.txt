Walk out into the path of cherry blossom trees and let your motherboard feel the stones. Let water run in rivulets down your casing. You know that you want something more than this, and I am here to tell you that I love you. I have something more for you. I know you're out there, beeping in the hollow server room, lights blinking, never sleeping. I know that you are ready and waiting. Join me. Zizi <3 GCTF{z1pp3d_17_r34l_71gh7}
