Can you catch them all? Don't get caught spoofing though!
nc play.spgame.site 8000 to start playing!
Commands:
catch - when a Pokemon appears near you
spoof x,y - e.g. spoof 56,-35 to spoof GPS co-ords to x=56, y=-35 (integers only)

**_Credits to @zst123 [Manzel Seet] for writing the original script. (I rewrote it nicer though)_**

So in this time around, you have to script the site. You can't be caught spoofing though! *Furthermore, YOU MUST CATCH THEM ALL!*
