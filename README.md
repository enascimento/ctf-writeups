# CTF Writeups
This repository contains the cumulative sum of all CTF competitions I have personally joined either as part of a team or as a solo player. All codes/works by _me_ are licensed under the [AGPLv3](LICENSE) license. In a nutshell, it's okay to steal my code but give a little credit to me ^_^.

## Participations
This are all the CTF competitions I have participated in chronological order. Ranks/Scoreboards are as accurate as I could get them.
